# PSDK Technical Demo
PSDK Technical Demo is a standard Pok√©monSDK/Studio project which aims to let beginners create their fangame the best way possible by giving them as many information as possible, such as:
- how to use basic RMXP commands
- how to use Pok√©monSDK commands
- how to create complex events
- how to make the link between the information created with Studio in Pok√©monSDK
- and much more...

It features all of the above in the form of a small educational game which lasts around 3 to 4 hours.

## If you are a contributor

If you intend on contributing to this Technical Demo, you must first send a message on Discord to either **@pw_rey** or **@sirmalo**.

### Prerequisite
You will need to install:
- The latest version of [Pok√©mon Studio](https://github.com/PokemonWorkshop/PokemonStudio)
- A legally acquired copy of [RPG Maker XP](https://store.steampowered.com/app/235900/RPG_Maker_XP/) and a good understanding of how to use it
- The latest version of [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) and experience with it

You must also possess a [Discord](https://discord.com/) account to discuss about your future contributions.

### Cloning and installation
Next, clone the repo via git:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:PokemonWorkshop/PSDKTechnicalDemo.git
cd PSDKTechnicalDemo
git clone https://gitlab.com/pokemonsdk/pokemonsdk.git
```
If you want to use your own PSDK codebase, you can clone the official PSDK repository at the root of the Technical Demo. If you don't, the codebase used will the stable one included in Pok√©mon Studio.

After cloning the repository, open the project with Studio and launch the project with it at least one time to let Studio generate the proper psdk.bat. The game will crash because as you don't have the .rxdata files.

To get these files, make sure to launch the cmd.bat file at the root of the folder and type `psdk --util=restore`. This will regenerate the .rxdata files from the .yml files. This step is **mandatory**.


### Starting contributing
The PSDK Technical Demo uses .yml files for the versioning of maps and data related to RPG Maker XP. This is done through the use of 2 different files:
- `convert_rxdata_to_yml.bat`, which converts .rxdata files (RMXP) to .yml files. This file **must** be run before any attempt to commit or before trying to rebase your branch (make sure to save anything done in RMXP, close the program, run the file, then commit)
- `convert_yml_to_rxdata.bat`, which converts back .yml files to .rxdata files. This file **must** be run after any pull or rebase.

### Managing work to avoid conflicts
To ensure we avoid as many conflicts as possible, here are some rules to follow as best as possible:
- Name branches should start with the `maps/`, `events/`, `texts/`, `resources/` folder path. Example: `maps/new-map`, `events/new-map`, `texts/translation-new-map`, `resources/new-ui`
- For the mapping part and the eventing part of a specific map, only one contributor is allowed to work on each of these categories. Here are some situations and whether it is allowed or not.
  - ‚úÖ `Contributor A works on reworking the mapping of Map X. Contributor B works on some events of Map X.`
  - ‚úÖ `Contributor A works on the mapping of Map X. Contributor A also works on the events of Map X as the mapping changes require to adapt some events.`
  - ‚õî `Contributor A works on the mapping of Map X to add some animated tiles. Contributor B also works on the mapping of Map X to correct some things.`
  - ‚õî `Contributor A works on correcting some events on Map X and adds one or two new events due to these corrections. Contributor B is adding new events to Map X due to new features to show.`
- Following previous rule: always communicate about what you want to start/do. Always ask if anyone else is doing something on the map you want to work on. Also check the ClickUp to know which tasks are required to be treated.
- A Tiled map conversion should be done by the contributor on their branch and the result added to the commit/PR for this branch.
- RMXP texts are written in english first. Translations in french are done in a second time.

## If you are a Pok√©monSDK/Pok√©mon Studio user

### Information about playing the Demo
Here is everything you need to know to enjoy this demo to the fullest.
- It is **STRONGLY** recommended that you play the game first before opening it with RMXP, as it was made to be an educational game. If you play it, you'll understand a lot quicker which event does what, and you'll know where to find the right events.
  - The game is considered finished when you have found the 16 Intriguing Stones and talked to SirMalo in the Hub. You will find one in all maps, except for the Hub and the two elevators.
  - This game was made with lots of time, dedication and love by Rey and SirMalo.
  - The game was thoroughly tested by around 25 testers. Of course, some last minutes oddities might have been forgotten. Let us know on the Discord server of you find any of these bugs!
- In front of every message, you'll find a series of number. Example: `3, 30 This is a message`. This series indicates the CSV file and the line you should seek. Pok√©monSDK uses CSV for enabling translations of your game, and this code indicates Pok√©monSDK to seek the CSV `3.csv`, at the line 30. Warning: 30 here actually counts as line 32 when opened in any respectable text editing software (VSCode is highly recommended), as the first line (fr, en, etc.) isn't counted, and counting in Ruby starts at 0. Always remember to add 2 to your number to find the proper line, or substract 2 to go from the line to the right code to input in an event.
  - Do not mistake `3, 30` for `\t[3, 30]` as those two strings aren't the same thing. In the case of `\t[3, 30]`, this string will indicate Pok√©monSDK to get the text in the CSV `100003.csv`. The line logic from previous paragraph is still valid.

### Information about this base project
Here are some information about this base project:
- This base project uses Tiled by default. The maps, tilesets, and assets are located in Data/Tiled. Your own maps/tilesets/assets **MUST** be located at the same places.
- It is recommended you keep these maps in your project to be able to refer to these at any times. But you can also create two projects: your own without the demo, and a project solely for tests and for refering to the demo.
  - If you go the second route, make sure to delete the maps in Studio, and delete the tilesets in the RMXP tileset editor **before** initiating the first Tiled map conversion.
- The maps **WILL** look weird in RMXP after a Tiled map conversion involving animated tiles. This behavior is totally normal and the maps will look absolutely fine ingame. To ensure we could convert Tiled animated tiles to RMXP, we had to make this choice to ensure the best compatibility.

Thank you for choosing to use Pok√©monSDK and Pok√©mon Studio to make your fangame, and we hope you'll enjoy this demo! ‚ù§
